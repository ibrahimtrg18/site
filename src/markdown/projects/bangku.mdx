## Bangku

Developed a job listing management system that optimizes API fetching and integrates Firebase authentication to enhance user experience and application performance. The system includes dynamic job display, secure API calls with authorization, and custom user notifications.

### Role

- Integrated Firebase authentication with dynamic token-based API requests for enhanced security.
- Optimized redundant API calls by leveraging react-query cache and query key management.
- Built custom toast notifications with react-toastify, including personalized icons, themes, and styles.
- Created reusable utility functions for localStorage to handle client-side data persistence.
- Ensured seamless user experience by refetching API data when authentication status changes.

### Technology Used

- Frontend: React, TypeScript, React Query, React Toastify.
- Backend Integration: Firebase Auth, Axios.
- Styling: Emotion CSS-in-JS.
- Tools: Browser LocalStorage, REST APIs.
