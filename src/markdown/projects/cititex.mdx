## Cititex

Welcome to Cititex, your premier destination for contemporary casual wear that seamlessly blends style and comfort. Our diverse collection includes plain t-shirts, hoods, jackets, combed fabrics, windbreakers, raglan designs, and polo shirts, ensuring you stay effortlessly fashionable.

### Role:

In this project, my primary objective was to create a seamless and user-friendly e-commerce system, making online shopping a breeze for our valued customers. Previously, this website was only accessible to internal customers for ordering, but I have now made it fully accessible to the public and more user-friendly.

### Contribution:

- **Development & Maintenance:** I led the creation, development, and ongoing maintenance of the Cititex web app, ensuring a smooth and engaging online shopping experience for visitors.
- **Dual Dashboard Management:** I designed and implemented two dashboards. The first empowers content management across our websites, keeping our digital presence fresh and vibrant. The second dashboard focuses on store management, streamlining operations and enhancing the overall shopping experience.
- **Technical Migration:** I played a pivotal role in transitioning the backend from PHP Symfony to Node.js Nest, facilitating a more agile and efficient development process.

### Technology Used:

- **HTML & CSS:** Crafting the visual foundation of our web app with attention to detail and aesthetics.
- **SASS:** Elevating styles to ensure a unique and appealing visual identity.
- **React.js & Redux:** Harnessing the power of these frameworks to create dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
- **Node.js & Nest.js:** Building a robust and scalable backend infrastructure.
- **MySQL:** Managing data with precision and efficiency, ensuring seamless transactions and interactions.
- **Git & AWS:** Implementing version control and deploying on AWS for a seamless and reliable user experience.
- **Asana:** Utilizing this platform for streamlined project management, ensuring efficient collaboration and timely deliveries.
