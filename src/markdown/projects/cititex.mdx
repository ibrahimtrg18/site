## Cititex

Welcome to Cititex, your premier destination for contemporary casual wear that seamlessly blends style and comfort. Our diverse collection includes plain t-shirts, hoods, jackets, combed fabrics, windbreakers, raglan designs, and polo shirts, ensuring you stay effortlessly fashionable.

### My Role: Crafting Seamless E-Commerce Experiences

In this project, my primary objective was to create a seamless and user-friendly e-commerce system, making online shopping a breeze for our valued customers. Previously, this website was only accessible to internal customers for ordering, but I have now made it fully accessible to the public and more user-friendly.

### Key Contributions:

- **Dual Dashboard Management:** I designed and implemented two dashboards. The first empowers content management across our websites, keeping our digital presence fresh and vibrant. The second dashboard focuses on store management, streamlining operations and enhancing the overall shopping experience.
- **Technical Migration:** I played a pivotal role in transitioning the backend from PHP Symfony to Node.js Nest, facilitating a more agile and efficient development process.
