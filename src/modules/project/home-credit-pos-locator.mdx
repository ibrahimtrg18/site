## Home Credit Indonesia - POS Locator

The POS Locator is a dedicated microfrontend application designed to help customers quickly find the nearest Home Credit service points and partner outlets across Indonesia. It provides an intuitive map-based experience, enabling users to search by city, region, or specific keywords.

### Role:

As a Software Engineer, I was responsible for building and integrating the POS Locator as an independent microfrontend module, ensuring it seamlessly connects with the main Home Credit Indonesia website.

### Contribution:

- **Microfrontend Development**: Designed and developed the POS Locator as a standalone web application hosted on api.homecredit.co.id, while integrating it with the main site at homecredit.co.id/temukan-lokasi-kami.
- **Map & Location Services**: Implemented an interactive map interface that allows users to search, filter, and explore nearby partners, enhancing accessibility for customers.
- **API Integration**: Connected with internal APIs to fetch and display up-to-date partner and location data.
- **Reusable Architecture**: Built the microfrontend to be independent, modular, and easily maintainable, allowing future scaling and integration with other Home Credit services.
- **Customer Journey Enhancement**: Simplified the process for customers to discover where they can apply for financing or get assistance, supporting both online and offline engagement.
- **Performance & Reliability**: Ensured smooth load times and responsive design across devices, improving usability on desktop and mobile.

### Technology Used:

- **Frontend**: HTML5, SCSS, TypeScript, Webpack Module Federation, React.js, React Query
- **Backend**: Java
- **Database**: PostgreSQL / Redis
